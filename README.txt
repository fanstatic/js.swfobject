Introduction
============

This library packages `SWFObject`_ for `fanstatic`_.

.. _`fanstatic`: http://fanstatic.org
.. _`SWFObject`: https://code.google.com/p/swfobject/

This requires integration between your web framework and ``fanstatic``,
and making sure that the original resources (shipped in the ``resources``
directory in ``js.swfobject``) are published to some URL.
